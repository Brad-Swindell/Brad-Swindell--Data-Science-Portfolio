## [Project 1: Binary Classification - Python code and Machine Learning Models for Prediction](https://github.com/Brad-Swindell/Binary-Classification-Model--Python--HR-Data)

 - Using input HR turnover data set from Kaggle web site:  https://www.kaggle.com/giripujar/hr-analytics
 - Read in data via Python Pandas DataFrame, conducted initial review of fields and data analysis via Pivot Tables.
 - Converted String data fields to numeric using a look-up table for one and GetDummies command for the other. 
 - Create Training and Testing datasets and run Logistic Regression, SVC, and Random Forest Machine Learning models for prediction.
 - Random Forest is best prediction model for this data with a score of 99.

## [Project 2: SQL Database Table Joins in Python - EDA and Data Visualization](https://github.com/Brad-Swindell/SQL-Python-EDA---Pitchfork-Record-Review-DB)

 - Using Pitchfork Album Review SQL database from Kaggle web site: https://www.kaggle.com/nolanbconaway/pitchfork-data
 - The multiple-table SQLite database is read into a DataFrame with Inner Join statements in Python.
 - Exploratory Data Analysis is performed to analyze key variables and relationships. 
 - DataFrame with the top 4 record labels represented for visualization 
 - A Plotly Express "SunBurst" chart created to display Pitchfork's top record labels and music genres for each one.

## [Project 4: SQL Wildfire database in Python - Visualization and Multi-Class Prediction Model](https://github.com/Brad-Swindell/SQL-Python-Multiclass-Classification--Wildefire-DB)

 - Using Wildfire SQL database from Kaggle web site: https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/188-million-us-wildfires
 - Exploratory Data Analysis is performed to analyze key variables in US Wildfires and relationships. 
 - Assume Domain Knowledge to add a Category to the different types of Wildfire Causes. 
 - Add Plotly Express "Tree Map" chart to visually show the categories and causes of wildfires. 
 - Create Logistic Model to predict the Category of wildfires given other variables.
