**Data Science Portfolio - Projects using Python, SQL, R, Pandas, and Machine Learning Models**


## [Project 1 - Binary Classification Model - Using Python and Logistic Regression Model](https://github.com/Brad-Swindell/Binary-Classification-Model--Python--HR-Data)


 - Using input data from Kaggle DataSet:  https://www.kaggle.com/giripujar/hr-analytics

 - Data includes several data fields about employees, and a 0/1 indicator if they left the company.
 

STEPS PERFORMED IN THE ANALYSIS:
 
 1.) Read in Data and initial review of fields and data.
 
 2.) Use Pivot Tables to analyze key turnover variable, "left" against other variables in the data.

 3.) Create different DataFrames for employees who stayed and who left for analysis.
 
 4.) Create Histograms of values to visualize the differences in staying/leaving in key variables.
 
 5.) Convert salary text field with "Low"/"Medium"/"High" values to numeric for model analysis.
 
 6.) Convert Catagorical/Text Field 'Department' into seperate fields using Get_Dummies Command.
 
 7.) Seperate the data variables from the prediction variable.
 
 8.) Run train_test_split command to prepare data for training and testing.
 
 9.) Run Logistic Regression model for prediction.
