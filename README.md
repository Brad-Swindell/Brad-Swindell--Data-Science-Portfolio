## [Project 1: Binary Classification Prediction Model - Using Python code and Logistic Regression Model](https://github.com/Brad-Swindell/Binary-Classification-Model--Python--HR-Data)

 - Using input HR turnover data set from Kaggle web site:  https://www.kaggle.com/giripujar/hr-analytics
 - Read in Data via Python Pandas, conducted initial review of fields and data analysis via Pivot Tables.
 - Converted String data fields to numeric using a look-up table and GetDummies command. 
 - Create Training and Testing datasets and run Logistic Regression model for prediction.

## [Project 2: SQL Database Table Joins in Python - EDA and Data Visualization](https://github.com/Brad-Swindell/SQL-Python-EDA---Pitchfork-Record-Review-DB)

 - Using Pitchfork Album Review SQL database from Kaggle web site: https://www.kaggle.com/nolanbconaway/pitchfork-data
 - The multiple-table SQLite database is read into a DataFrame with Inner Join statements in Python.
 - Exploratory Data Analysis is performed to analyze key variables and relationships. 
 - DataFrame with the top 4 record labels represented for visualization 
 - A Plotly Express "SunBurst" chart created to display Pitchfork's top record labels and music genres for each one.
